        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          This portfolio website was built with Angular and is inspired by
          Spotify's interface. It showcases my projects, experience, and skills
          in a unique and interactive way.

          <h3>Music & Photography</h3>
          <p>
            The tracks playing on this site are my personal favorite songs that
            I recommend - a small glimpse into my music taste.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Spotify playlist covers you see throughout the site are photos
            I've taken myself, which I also use for my own Spotify playlists.
