          <h3>Beyond Coding</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring the
            outdoors. I'm an avid hiker who finds both peace and inspiration on
            mountain trails. The mountains have been my playground for
            discovering breathtaking views and challenging myself physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bouldering and rock climbing have become my moving meditation - a
            perfect balance of mental problem-solving and physical strength that
            complements my approach to programming challenges. There's something
            uniquely satisfying about methodically working through a difficult
            route, much like debugging a complex piece of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for photography naturally intertwines with these
            adventures, allowing me to capture and share the moments that
            inspire me. You can see glimpses of this in the playlist covers
            throughout this site - all photos I've taken myself. Combined with
            my love for music, these interests form the creative counterbalance
            to my technical work.

        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>
          This portfolio website was built with Angular and is inspired by
          Spotify's interface. It showcases my projects, experience, and skills
          in a unique and interactive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tracks playing on this site are my personal favorite songs -
          another glimpse into who I am beyond the code. And those playlist
          covers? They're all photos I've taken during my outdoor adventures.
